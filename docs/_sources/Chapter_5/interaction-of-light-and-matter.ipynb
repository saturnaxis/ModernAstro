    "## Spectral Lines\n",
    "Some philosophers during the Renaissance considered strict limits to human knowledge, while other natural philosophers used experimentation to probe reality.  In 1800, William Wollaston showed that a number of **dark spectral lines** were present within the a rainbow-like spectrum using sunlight.  By 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer cataloged 475 of the dark lines (i.e., [Fraunhofer lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines)) in the solar spectrum. Fraunhofer determined that the wavelength of one prominent dark line in the Sun's spectrum corresponds to the yellow light emitted by salt in a flame.  The new science of *spectroscopy* was born with the discovery of the sodium line.\n",

    "### Kirchoff's Laws\n",
    "The foundations of spectroscopy (and modern chemistry) were established in the 1800s with [Robert Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen) and [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff).  Bunsen's burner produced a colorless flame that was ideal for studying the colors produced by burning a range of substances.  Bunsen and Kirchoff designed a *spectroscope* that passed the light of a flame spectrum through a prism.  They determined that the wavelengths of light absorbed and emitted by an element fit together like a lock and key.  Kirchoff determined that 70 of the Fraunhofer lines were due to iron vapor.  In 1860, Kirchoff and Bunsen developed the idea that every element produces its own pattern of spectral lines and thus the elements had \"fingerprints\".  Kirchoff summarized the production of spectral lines in three laws (i.e., **Kirchoff's Laws**):\n",

A particle in a circular orbit experiences an acceleration, where Maxwell showed that accelerating charges emit electromagnetic radiation.

    "In a double-slit experiment, a photon or electron passes through *both* slits to produce the interference pattern on the other side.  The wave doesn't convey information about where the particle is, rather only where it *may* be.  As a result, the wave is described by a probability with and amplitude $\\Psi$.  The amplitude squared, $\\left<\\Psi|x|\\Psi\\right>$, describes the probability of finding the particle at a certain location $x$.  For the double-slit experiment, particles are never found where the sum of two probability functions equal zero (i.e., destructive interference).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n",
    "A probability wave $\\Psi$ for a particle can have a precise description as a sine wave with a wavelength $\\lambda$.  Through de Broglie's wavelength, the particle's momentum can also be defined exactly ($p = h/\\lambda$), but the particle is not localized and means the particle's position is perfectly uncertain.  The particle's position can be constrained when several sine waves with a range of wavelengths are added so they destructively interfere almost everywhere.  The result is $\\Psi$ (the probability) is approximately zero almost everywhere, except for a narrow range of $x$.  By adding more waves, and there wavelengths, the particle's momentum is now a range of values (i.e., more uncertain).  "

    "### Quantum Mechanical Tunneling\n",
    "Light changes its behavior at boundary transitions, where this is most easily seen for a light beam traveling from a prism (glass) into air.  The light may undergo *total internal reflection* if its incident angle is greater than a critical angle $\\theta_c$ that is determined by the indices of refraction of the glass and air.  The critical angle $\\theta_c$ can be derived from Snell's law to get\n",

    "The electromagnetic wave does enter the air, but it dies away exponentially (i.e., becomes *evanescent*).  When another prism is placed next to the first, then the evanescent wave can begin propagating into the second prism without passing through the air gap between them.  Photons have **tunneled** from one prism to another.  The limitation to this effect is through Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, where the location of a particle (i.e., photon) cannot be determined with an uncertainty less than its wavelength.  For barriers that are only a few wavelengths wide, a particle can suddenly appear on the other side.  **Barrier penetration** is important for radioactive decay and inside stars, where nuclear fusion rates depend upon tunneling.\n",

    "The Schr&ouml;dinger equation can be solved analytically for the hydrogen atom and it produces the same set of allowed energies obtained by Bohr.  However, Schr&ouml;dinger found that two additional quantum numbers $\\ell$ and $m_\\ell$ are required for a complete description of the electron orbitals.  The principal quantum number $n$ determines the energy level, where these quantum numbers describe the angular momentum vector **L** of the atom.  The magnitude of the angular momentum $L$ are\n",

    "where $\\ell = \\{0,\\ldots,n-1 \\}$.  Early spectroscopists categorized some elements based on their alkali metal spectroscopic lines described as **s**harp, **p**rincipal, **d**iffuse, and **f**undamental and this historical [nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital) corresponded with $\\ell = 0,1,2,3$.  The letters continues alphabetically where $\\ell = 4\\rightarrow g$, $\\ell = 5\\rightarrow h$, and so on (omitting $j$).  Chemists now use a nomenclature that includes both the principal and angular momentum quantum numbers together (e.g., $n\\ell$).  For example, ($n=2$, $\\ell=1$) corresponds to $2p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $z$-component of the angular momentum vector $L_z$ can assume only particular values designated by the quantum number $m_\\ell$ (i.e., $L=m_\\ell\\hbar$), which ranges from $-\\ell$ to $+\\ell$ resulting in $2\\ell +1$ possible integers.  For *isolated* hydrogen atoms, there is not a preferred direction for the angular momentum vector to point and thus, a **degeneracy** exists with respect to the energy (i.e., the electron has the same energy independent of $\\ell$ and $m_\\ell$) and will produce the *same* spectral line.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, hydrogen gas in a star is not isolated and the electrons will feel the effect of the stellar magnetic field.  Due to the external magnetic field the energy levels are no longer degenerate and the spectral lines are observed to split.  The simplest case is described by the [Zeeman effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeeman_effect), where the $2p$ orbital is split into three lines; $p=1$ and $m_\\ell = \\{-1,0,+1\\}$.  The $m_\\ell = 0$ line appears at a frequency $\\nu_o$ that corresponds to the spectral line in the absence of the magnetic field. The other two lines are produced depending on the magnetic field strength $B$ and reduced mass $\\mu$ to produce the frequencies\n",

    "Quantum mechanics was at odds with Schr&ouml;dinger's (non-relativistic) wave equation and Einstein's theory of special relativity.  Paul Dirac worked to combine the two theories and succeeded in writing a relativistic wave equation for the electron that naturally included the spin of the electron.  His relativistic wave equation extended the Pauli exclusion principle by dividing the world of particles into two groups: fermions and bosons.\n",

A particle differs from its antiparticle in its charge and magnetic moment (e.g., electron $e^-$ and positron $e^+$); all other properties are the same.  Pairs of particles and antiparticles may be created from the energy of gamma-ray photons (e.g., $\\gamma \\rightarrow e^- + e^+$) or annihilate each other to produce gamma-rays (e.g., $e^- + e^+ \\rightarrow \\gamma$).

Similar to quantum tunneling, there remains a small but finite probability for forbidden transitions to occur and they require much longer timescales.  Collisions between atoms trigger transitions and can compete with spontaneous transitions.  Thus, very low gas densities are required to obtain a sufficient signal to measure the forbidden transitions.  In the diffuse interstellar medium or the outer atmospheres of stars, this condition is met."
