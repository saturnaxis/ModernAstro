Much of the theoretical foundation was understood in the first half of the 20th Century, it wasn't until the 1960s that computers were advanced enough to carry out all the calculations.  Although computer modeling is a success, there are numerous questions that remain unanswered.\n",

    "The theoretical study of stellar structure shows that stars are dynamic objects that typically change over very slow timescales (compared to us mortals), but some events can be very rapid and dramatic.  Consider the observed energy output of the Sun, which is $3.839 \\times 10^{26}$ J of energy emitted per second.  This energy output would be sufficient to melt a column of ice with a square mile area and 1 AU thick in only 0.3 seconds (assuming 100% absorption efficiency).  Stars have a finite supply of energy, where they must eventually use up their fuel and die.  *Stellar evolution is the result of a constant fight against the relentless pull of gravity.*"

    "In stellar interiors, energy is transported through **radiation**, **convection**, and **conduction**.  \n",

    "- Radiation allows the energy produced by nuclear reactions and gravitation to be carried to the surface via *photons*.  The photons are absorbed and re-emitted in nearly random directions as the encounter matter, where the opacity must play an important role.\n",
    "- Convection can be more efficient in some parts of the star with hot, buoyant mass elements carrying excess energy outward while cool elements fall inward (i.e., an energy escalator).\n",
    "- Conduction transports heat via collisions between particles, which is the least efficient method for stellar environments.  As a result, it is generally insignificant throughout a majority of the stellar lifetime.\n",

    "Once the temperature gradient becomes too steep, convection becomes the more efficient method in the transport of energy.  Convection involves mass motions: *hot parcels of matter move upward as cooler, denser parcels sink*.  Unfortunately, convection is more complex than radiation at the macroscopic level.  *Fluid mechanics* is a field of physics that describes the motion of gases and liquids through the 3D [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations).  Solving these equations is very difficult, even for computers, and it becomes necessary to approximate the solution through a 1D model.  Additionally, the equations are non-linear, which can lead to turbulent (and chaotic) flows rather than laminar flows.  Turbulence is characterized by the amount of *viscosity* (fluid friction) and heat dissipation.  The timescale for convection is in some cases approximately equal to timescales for structural changes in the star.\n",

    "## The Main Sequence\n",
    "The analysis of stellar spectra shows that the atmospheres of most stars are composed primarily of hydrogen $(X\\sim 0.7)$, whereas the fraction of metal varies $(0< Z < 0.03)$.  If the initial stellar composition is homogenous, then the first set of nuclear reactions should be the pp chains and/or the CNO cycle because they convert hydrogen into helium.  The core of a star is predominantly hydrogen and the stellar interior will evolve slowly due to the nuclear reactions.  Most stars have similar compositions and thus, stellar structure should smoothly vary with mass.  This is apparent when we see the central pressure and temperature increasing along with the total mass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For low mass stars the pp chain will dominate because it doesn't have enough gravity to overcome the Coulomb barrier of heavier nuclei.  For high mass stars, the CNO cycle will likely dominate because of its strong temperature dependence. For progressively less massive stars, the central temperature will eventually fall below the critical point for fusion and are no longer able to stabilize the star against gravitational contraction.  This critical point depends on the stellar metal mass fraction, where $0.072\\:M_\\odot$ is for solar composition and metal free stars ($Z=0$) the value climbs to $0.09\\:M_\\odot$.  For extremely massive stars $(\\ge 90\\:M_\\odot)$ thermal oscillations in the core may produce significant variations that affect the nuclear energy generation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Eddington Luminosity Limit\n",
    "The stability of vey massive stars is directly affect by their extremely high luminosities.  If the temperature is sufficiently high and gas density is low, then it is possible for the radiation pressure to dominate over the gas pressure.  When this occurs in the outer portions of very massive (or large) stars, the outer layers can disperse due to the intense stellar wind.  Using the conditions for radiant flux and luminosity, the pressure gradient near the stellar surface is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dP}{dr} \\simeq -\\frac{\\overline{\\kappa}\\rho}{c}\\frac{L}{4\\pi r^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But the pressure gradient is related to the local gravity $dP/dr = -g\\rho$.  Combining and solving for luminosity, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L_{\\rm Ed} = \\frac{4\\pi r^2 c}{\\overline{\\kappa}}g = \\frac{4\\pi G c}{\\overline{\\kappa}}M_\\star. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum radiative luminosity $L_{\\rm Ed}$ (or **Eddington limit**) is a maximum value for a star to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium.  If $L>L_{\\rm Ed}$, then mass loss must occur that is driven by radiation pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to estimate the Eddington luminosity for stars on the upper end of the main sequence (i.e., very hot and bright).  The effective temperatures of these stars are ~50,000 K, where most of the hydrogen is ionized in the photosphere.  The major contribution to the opacity is from [electron scattering](https://saturnaxis.github.io/ModernAstro/Chapter_9/stellar-atmospheres.html#the-rosseland-mean-opacity) $\\overline{\\kappa}_{es}$, \n",

    "### Variations of Main-Sequence Stellar Parameters with Mass\n",
    "From theoretical models computed in the mass range of hydrogen burning, it is possible to obtain a numerical $M-L$ relationship that agrees well with the observational $M-L$ relationship.  Stars undergoing hydrogen burning in the cores lie along the observational main sequence.  The range in main-sequence luminosities range from $5\\times 10^{-4}\\:L_\\odot$ to $1 \\times 10^6\\:L_\\odot$; a variation of nine orders of magnitude, while the masses change by only three orders of magnitude.  Due to the higher energy output from upper main-sequence stars, they consume their core hydrogen quicker.  Therefore, *main-sequence lifetimes decrease with increasing luminosity*.  Effective temperature are much less dependent on stellar mass because they are determined from the photosphere, not the core.  However the variation is still large enough to dramatically change the stellar spectrum.\n",

    "The interior structure of stars along the main sequence stars also varies with mass, primarily in the location of convection zones.  For stars that produce energy mainly through the CNO cycle, convection is dominant in the core.  Outside of the core, radiation is capable of transporting the flux and convection ceases.  At ~1.2 $M_\\odot$, the pp chain begins to dominate and the core becomes radiative.  Meanwhile the stellar surface cools with decreasing mass and the opacity increases because (in part) by the location of the hydrogen ionization zone.  The increased opacity makes convection more efficient near the surface.  The bottom of the surface convection zone grows deeper until the entire star becomes convective near 0.3 $M_\\odot$."
