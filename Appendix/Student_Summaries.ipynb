Determining the Internal Structures of Stars
Starting in the 1960s computers became advanced enough to carry out calculations for modeling the internal structure of stars.
The study of stellar structure shows us that stars change over very slow timesclaes compared to human life.
Some stellar events can be very rapid and dramatic.
Stars have a limited supply of energy, where they eventually use up the energy and die.
Stellar evolution is the result of a constant fight against the pull of gravity.
7.1.2
The Derivation of the Hydrostatic Equilibrium Equation
An electrostatic force has opposite charges, where gravitational force is always attractive.

An opposing force must exit in a star to avoid collapse.
The pressure within a star varies with depth.
Consider a cylinder of mass dm whose base is located a distance r from the center of a spherical star.

The top and bottom of the cylinder each have an area A and the height is dr.
We assume that the only forces acting on the cylinder are gravity and the force due to pressure, which is always normal to the top and bottom cylinder surface.
These forces also vary with the cylinder's distance from the center of the star.
Using Newton's second law F=ma, this is the net force along the central axis of the cylinder dmd2rdt2=Fg+Fp,top+Fp,bot, where the gravitational force Fg and pressure force on the top of the cylinder F_{p,top} are directed inward, while the pressure force on the bottom Fp,bot of the cylinder is directed upward.

The pressure forces on the curved side of the cylinder will cancel due to symmetry and have been explicitly excluded from the expression.
The pressure force at the top and bottom of the cylinder are at different sepths, and we can rewrite the equation from Newton's second law
7.1.3
The Equation of Mass Conservation
A relationship for spherical symmetry can be derived using mass, radius, and density.
This can be done by considering a shell of mass dMr and thickness dr located a distance r from the center of the shell.
we assume that dr is less than r
the volume of the shell is 4πr2dr
Using the relation for density, we can find the mass conservation equation, dMrdr=4πr2p
This equation describes the mass distribution within a star.
7.2
Pressure Equation of State
Gas has the properties of mass, density, temperature, pressure, and volume that describe how it exist.
This is the state that the gas is in
The state represents a macroscopic view of the particle and its interactions.
This information is necessary to derive a pressure equation of state for the gas.
The ideal gas law is an example of a pressure equation of state. PV=NkT=nRT
This ideal gas law relates the gas pressure P, volume V, and Temperature T, to the number of particles N.
k is the Boltzmann constant, and R is the gas constant.
For astrophysical problems, we need a pressure equation of state that is more general than the ideal gas law.
7.2.1
The Derivation of the Pressure Integral
The pressure of a gas is the force per area exerted on the walls of its container due to collisions.
A gas is in a cylinder of length x and cross-sectional area A. The gas is composed of point particles, each of mass m, that interact through perfectly elastic collisions.
The gas exerts a pressure on one end of the container.
The impact of an individual particle on the container wall is described through a change in momentum.
Newton's second and third laws can be applied.
For a perfectly elastic collision, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
The particle approaches the wall in the positive x-direction and rebounds along the negative x-direction.
Using Newton's 3rd Law, the impulse delivered tot he wall is, 2pxi
this is using the x-component of the particle's initial momentum px.
The average force exerted by the particle per unit time can be dertermined by the time interval between collisions.
the shortest time interval is when the particle traverses the length of the cylinder twice before returning for a second reflection.
The average force exerted on the wall by a single particle over a time period is given by, F=2pxΔt=pxvxΔx.
In this equation it is assumed that the force vector is normal to the surface.
The average force per particle having a momentum p is F(p)=pv3Δx
It is usually the case that the particles have a range of incident angles.
this makes the number of particles with momenta between p and p+dp similar to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
it is given by the expression Npdp.
The sum of all the forces exerted by particle collisions is F=13∫NpΔxpvdp
The pressure exerted on the wall is, P=FA=13∫nppvdp.
This equation is called the pressure integral, which allows us to compute the pressure given a distribution function.
