    "Students will work in pairs to produce summaries of each class meeting.  These summaries should list the main topics discussed and emphasized ideas/examples during the respective lecture.  Students are encouraged to be as detailed as possible without being overly verbose.  The summaries should be submitted as a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) from **your forked repository** before the next class meeting.\n"

    "- **1.1 Stellar Parallax** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Trigonometric parallax**: measurement of angular displacement of an object from two different vantage points creating a known baseline distance $B$ between observers. $d = B/tan(p)$. $tan(p)$ comes from small angle approximations, so we can use $p\"$ (\" standing for arcseconds) for angle values smaller than $1$ arcsecond.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The angles at which these stars move relative to the much more distant stars in the background are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $3600$ arcseconds per $1$ degree because of $1/60/60 = 1/3600$. You have $360$ degrees of sky, split $1$ of those degrees into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcminutes. Then you take $1$ of those arcminutes and split that into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Arcseconds are very small amounts of angle, and can be divided further for smaller movements across the night sky. Example: Proxima Centauri has a parallax angle of less than $1\"$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We measure stellar distances in units of parsecs (**par**allax-**sec**onds), 206,265 AU per parsec (great distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First successful measurement of stellar parallax in 1838 by **Fredrich Bessel** (1784-1846).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $1 pc = 3.2615638 ly$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Objects with small parallax angles have interfering conditions such as geologic tremors or atmospheric turbulence which make it hard to find accurate angles. Space missions such as Hipparcos don't have this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1.2 The Magnitude Scale** \n",
    "    - **1.2.1 Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Hipparchus** compiled a list of ~850 stars (some found by Persians before, he just added to the list and listed previously known ones) and compared their brightness. Later examinations of his scale showed that it was logarithmic because the human eye perceives the brightness of objects logarithmically.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Example: if a bright light source were $6$ times brighter than another, the human eye will determine the brighter object as approximately twice the brightness of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This means that the difference in brightness between two different magnitude stars is $100^{(m2-m1)/5}= ΔB$. Two stars separated by $1$ magnitude have a difference in brightness of $2.512$ times, or $100^{1/5}$. Two stars separated by 5 magnitudes have $100$ times difference in brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.2 Flux, Luminosity, and the Inverse Square Law**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Radiant flux $F$** is the brightness of a star measured by the total amount of radiation at all wavelengths that cross a unit of area per unit time. Definition depends on the energy emitted per second at the stellar surface (intrinsic luminosity $L$)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Luminosity $L$ is distributed uniformly across the surface area of a shell of radius $r$ surrounding a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This is the well-known inverse square law for light. The $4π$ factor is not necessarily needed as the radiant flux of some stars are given relative to the Solar Luminosity (L_sol) and the Earth-Sun distance (r_earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - $F = L/4πr^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.3 Flux Ratios and Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Absolute magnitude M** of a star is the apparent magnitude a star would have if it were located at a distance of $10 pc$. We can find the ratio of their flux to be, ${\\frac{F_2}{F_1}} = 100^{m_1-m_2/5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Logarithm of both sides of the flux ratio above gives an alternative form: $m_1-m_2 = -2.5log_{10}{\\frac{F_2}{F_1}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.4 Absolute Magnitude and the Distance Modulus**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Distance modulus**: $m-M = 5log_{10}(d)-5 = 5log_{10}{\\frac{d}{10 parsecs}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - How bright a star would be if it were $10 pc$ away is called the absolute magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Multiply the $10$ over from $d/10 pc = 10^{(m-M)/5}$ and that gives you the +5 being added to the two magnitudes in the exponent\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Goes from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7}$ because the $d/10$ you are just dividing by $10^{1}$ to make a more negative exponent.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - He used Kepler's original third law without universal gravitation. It wasn't until 1761 until we found out the distance of an AU, so that also hampered the mathematics needed to calculate the speed of light.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - Thomas Young's double-slit experiment: two waves of light interfering with each other going through the slits. **Destructive interference** occurs when the peaks and troughs of the light wave cancel eachother, making darker parts on the screen. **Constructive interference** occurs when there are brighter fringes.\n",

    "    - **1.3.4 The Poynting Vector and Radiation Pressure**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - EM waves carry both energy and momentum in the direction of propagation. The rate at which energy is carried by a light wave is described by the Poynting vector.\n",

    "        - $S=\\frac{1}{\\mu_0}ExB$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The Poynting vector is reliant on the cross product of the electric and magnetic field components of the EM wave. The units are in watts per meter squared $W m^{-2}$.\n",

Number of electrons collected in each pixel determines the brightness of the image.\n",

The Hayashi track represents a boundary between \"allowed\" and \"forbidden\" hydrostatic stellar models.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Consider the pre-main-sequence evolution of a 1 $M_\\odot$ star, beginning on the Hayashi track.** With the high ${\\rm H^-}$ opacity near the surface, the star is completely convective for the first 1 Myr, where deuterium burning also occurs during this early period of the collapse. \n",

    "- As the central temperature continues to rise, the levels of ionization increase but the opacity decreases.  \n",
    "- As the radiative core develops, more of the star's mass is encompassed by the core.  \n",
    "- Following the descent along the Hayashi track, the luminosity reaches a minimum and the radiative core allows energy to escape into the convective envelope more readily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- This causes the luminosity to increase again and the effective temperature increases since the star is still shrinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CNO reactions have a high temperature dependence and a temperature gradient is established in the core so that some convection begins to develop there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the carbon-12 is exhausted (for the CNO cycle), the core completes its readjustment to nuclear burning, where the remainder of the PP I chain becomes important. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the protostar mass is $\\lesssim 0.072\\,M_\\odot$, the core never gets hot enough to generate sufficient energy by nuclear reactions to stabilize the star against gravitational collapse.  The stable hydrogen-burning main sequence is never obtained, which explains the lower end of the main sequence.\n",

The first confirmed discovery of a brown dwarf (Gliese 229B) was announced in 1995.  Hundreds of brown dwarfs have been detected in near-IR all-sky surveys, such as [2MASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2MASS) or [SDSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey).\n",

During recombination, the electron cascades downward and produces a number of lower-energy photons (many will be in the visible).  The dominant visible wavelength comes from the $n=3$ to $n=2$ transition, or the ${\\rm H\\alpha}$ line of the Balmer series.  Therefore, ${\\rm H\\,II}$ regions appear to fluoresce in red light.\n",

The recombination rate can be multiplied by the volume of the ${\\rm H\\,II}$ region (assumed to be a sphere) and then set equal to the number of ionized photons produced per second.

Due to the star's high luminosity, radiation pressure will begin to drive significant mass loss that can disperse the remainder of the cloud.  Some famous examples of this occurring are in the Carina Nebula (about 3000 pc from Earth) and in the [Eagle Nebula (M16)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/m16L.html).\n",
