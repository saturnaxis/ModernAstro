    "- **1.1 Stellar Parallax** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Trigonometric parallax**: measurement of angular displacement of an object from two different vantage points creating a known baseline distance $B$ between observers. $d = B/tan(p)$. $tan(p)$ comes from small angle approximations, so we can use $p\"$ (\" standing for arcseconds) for angle values smaller than $1$ arcsecond.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The angles at which these stars move relative to the much more distant stars in the background are very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $3600$ arcseconds per $1$ degree because of $1/60/60 = 1/3600$. You have $360$ degrees of sky, split $1$ of those degrees into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcminutes. Then you take $1$ of those arcminutes and split that into $60$ pieces, giving you $60$ arcseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Arcseconds are very small amounts of angle, and can be divided further for smaller movements across the night sky. Example: Proxima Centauri has a parallax angle of less than $1\"$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We measure stellar distances in units of parsecs (**par**allax-**sec**onds), 206,265 AU per parsec (great distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First successful measurement of stellar parallax in 1838 by **Fredrich Bessel** (1784-1846).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $1 pc = 3.2615638 ly$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Objects with small parallax angles have interfering conditions such as geologic tremors or atmospheric turbulence which make it hard to find accurate angles. Space missions such as Hipparcos don't have this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1.2 The Magnitude Scale** \n",
    "    - **1.2.1 Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Hipparchus** compiled a list of ~850 stars (some found by Persians before, he just added to the list and listed previously known ones) and compared their brightness. Later examinations of his scale showed that it was logarithmic because the human eye perceives the brightness of objects logarithmically.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Example: if a bright light source were $6$ times brighter than another, the human eye will determine the brighter object as approximately twice the brightness of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This means that the difference in brightness between two different magnitude stars is $100^{(m2-m1)/5}= ΔB$. Two stars separated by $1$ magnitude have a difference in brightness of $2.512$ times, or $100^{1/5}$. Two stars separated by 5 magnitudes have $100$ times difference in brightness.\n",

    "    - **1.2.2 Flux, Luminosity, and the Inverse Square Law**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Radiant flux $F$** is the brightness of a star measured by the total amount of radiation at all wavelengths that cross a unit of area per unit time. Definition depends on the energy emitted per second at the stellar surface (intrinsic luminosity $L$)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Luminosity $L$ is distributed uniformly across the surface area of a shell of radius $r$ surrounding a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - This is the well-known inverse square law for light. The $4π$ factor is not necessarily needed as the radiant flux of some stars are given relative to the Solar Luminosity (L_sol) and the Earth-Sun distance (r_earth).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - $F = L/4πr^2$\n",

    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.3 Flux Ratios and Apparent Magnitude**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Absolute magnitude M** of a star is the apparent magnitude a star would have if it were located at a distance of $10 pc$. We can find the ratio of their flux to be, ${\\frac{F_2}{F_1}} = 100^{m_1-m_2/5}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Logarithm of both sides of the flux ratio above gives an alternative form: $m_1-m_2 = -2.5log_{10}{\\frac{F_2}{F_1}}$\n",

    "\n",
    "    - **1.2.4 Absolute Magnitude and the Distance Modulus**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Distance modulus**: $m-M = 5log_{10}(d)-5 = 5log_{10}{\\frac{d}{10 parsecs}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "        - How bright a star would be if it were $10 pc$ away is called the absolute magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Multiply the $10$ over from $d/10 pc = 10^{(m-M)/5}$ and that gives you the +5 being added to the two magnitudes in the exponent\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Goes from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7}$ because the $d/10$ you are just dividing by $10^{1}$ to make a more negative exponent.\n",

    "\n",
    "        - He used Kepler's original third law without universal gravitation. It wasn't until 1761 until we found out the distance of an AU, so that also hampered the mathematics needed to calculate the speed of light.\n",
